Email site administrators about all administrator logins.

== Description ==

There are numerous plugins for emailing or otherwise notifying administrators when users log into Wordpress. However, this is not desirable for installations with hundreds or thousands of users. Admin Login Monitor provides more managable email alerts, just for administrator accounts.

Example alert email,

```
Hello Alice,

The account 'bob' just logged into example.com



User Login 'bob'
User Display Name 'Bob'
User Email bob@example.com
User ID '8'
User Registered 2019-08-25 19:33:18

Forwarded IP Address 96.224.58.71 (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR)
Connected IP Address 96.224.58.71 (possibly a CDN or proxy)

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/15.5 Safari/605.1.15

This notification is generated by the Wordpress Admin Login Monitor plugin installed on example.com

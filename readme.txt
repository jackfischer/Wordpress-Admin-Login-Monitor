Warn site administrators about all administrator logins.

== Description ==

There are numerous plugins for emailing or otherwise notifying administrators when users log into Wordpress. However, this is not desirable for installations with hundreds or thousands of users. Admin Login Monitor provides more managable email alerts, just for administrator accounts.

Example alert email,
